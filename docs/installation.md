# Installation 

## Prerequisites

Before installing Gatecheck, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Go**: Version 1.22.0 or newer (only required if you plan to build the application from source).

## Installation Options

Gatecheck can be installed either by downloading the pre-compiled binary for your operating system or by compiling 
the source code. 

### Option 1: Installing from Binary

1. **Download the Binary**: Visit the Gatecheck GitHub releases page at 
     `https://github.com/gatecheckdev/gatecheck/releases` and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. **Unpack the Binary** (if necessary): For Windows and Linux, you may need to unpack the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file.
3. **Move the Binary to a Bin Directory**:
   - **Windows**: Move `gatecheck.exe` to a directory within your PATH, such as `C:\Windows`.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Move `gatecheck` to a location in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`. 
      You can use the command `mv gatecheck /usr/local/bin` in the terminal.

4. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `gatecheck --version` to ensure the application
    is installed correctly.

### Option 2: Building from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Gatecheck repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gatecheckdev/gatecheck
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
   ```
   cd gatecheck
   ```
3. **Build the Application**: Run the following command to compile Gatecheck with appropriate load flags:
   ```
    go build -ldflags="-X 'main.cliVersion=$(git describe --tags)' -X 'main.gitCommit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)' -X 'main.buildDate=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)' -X 'main.gitDescription=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B | tr \' _)'" -o ./bin ./cmd/gatecheck
   ```
4. **Move the Binary to a Bin Directory** (as described in Option 1, step 3).

5. **Verify Installation**: Check the application version to confirm successful installation:
   ```
   ./gatecheck --version
   ```

### Option 3: Use Just Recipe

[Just Command Runner](https://github.com/casey/just)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gatecheckdev/gatecheck
cd gatecheck
just install 
```

Will default to `/usr/local/bin` as the install directory, but this can be changed.

```shell
INSTALL_DIR='custom/location/bin' just install
```

## Post-Installation Steps

After installing Gatecheck, you can begin using it by typing `gatecheck` followed by the necessary commands and 
options in your terminal or command prompt. For a list of available commands and their descriptions, use:

install software on your system and that your Go environment is properly configured.
